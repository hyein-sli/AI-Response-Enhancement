obvious, but clearly get in the way. From quality and design to 
cutting-edge features, Seltos embarked on a mission to be a level 
above in every way, diminishing the significance of the term "small" 
to a mere size classification. High class Seltos — Seltos opens a new

Today, SUVs are mostly driven on asphalt, which is why they 
need to evolve and adapt to an urban environment while 
retaining primordial qualities. Seltos captures the bold and 
strong nature of SUVs in an elegant and luxurious way. Its 
10.25" UVO navigation and air conditioning controllers 
are sleek and seamless, while its soft crash pads come with 
luxurious in-mold stitching that is normally seen only in 
vehicles of a higher class. Exquisitely made side vents are 
reminiscent of hand-crafted goods, speaker and crash pad 
garnish lighting change in brightness to the beat of sounds, 
seats conform comfortably to passengers' body shapes, and 
a dynamic center console lives up to the toughness of a SUV. 
All are testaments to the utmost care and consideration given 
to the creation of Seltos, which combines multiple elements 
seamlessly into one, resonating the emotional code of 
millennials who are defining the new standards of luxury.

Communication in a car used to be limited to the occupants, but today, we 
live in an era where we can communicate with our cars using large displays. 
Whether it's your eyes, touch or voice, Seltos engages your 5 senses and 
builds a connection in many ways. It breaks down preconceptions about 
front space and back space and goes beyond the driver's seat. What you 
do may be different, but in Seltos, front and back spaces offer the same 
pampering experience that makes a ride equally satisfying no matter where 
you are seated. Being in Seltos in itself promises to be a premium experience.Space, challenging preconceptions
The interior of a car used to be regarded simply 
as a space for transportation.
Occupants only had 2 choices: to drive or to sit still.
Seltos challenges this concept of space and 
presents new thinking.
It breaks down the borders and reconceptualizes interior space.PDF  REFERENCE _ Mar 2, 2020. PDF  REFERENCE _ Mar 2, 2020.

Carefully applying pressure on the pedal to render good fuel economy, 
steering the car attentively while turning to avoid accidents, taking precautions 
when the car in front gets too close, and looking in all directions to park the 
car safely... these are all behaviors of the past. With thoughtfully developed 
cars like Seltos that dramatically take away the burden of driving, drivers no 
longer have to worry about A to Z. Rendering good fuel economy in spite 
of "stepping on it," ensuring safety and stability at all times, maintaining a 
safe speed and distance from cars in front, staying in the lane automatically, 
and being alerted about dangers to prevent accidents... now drivers can 
simply relax and enjoy the drive. This cutting-edge safety and convenience 
technology should not be limited to large vehicles and luxury cars and Seltos 
makes it accessible by turning technological egalitarianism into a reality.Changing notions about driving
Driving has always been a cumbersome and tiring task,
and all of the burden of driving has always been 
put on the driver. Now, the car is ready to take control.
The incredible experience of entrusting the car with driving,
it is only possible when the underlying technology is reliable.PDF  REFERENCE _ Mar 2, 2020. PDF  REFERENCE _ Mar 2, 2020.

Peace of mind for a more enjoyable

Gone are the days when the driver had to assess and decide on everything.

to be prudent. Drive Wise is the ultimate advanced driver assistance system 
that stops the car automatically, maintains lanes, controls distance and speed, 
and warns the driver about obstacles to prevent accidents.. It helps Seltos to 
act really smart.POWERFUL & FUTURISTIC

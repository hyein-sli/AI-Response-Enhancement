Meandering through a street by chance,
a camera in a shop window catches my eye.
Alas, I was a free spirit that loved photography...
A passion that I had long forgotten
being immersed in my work
is suddenly reawakened.
Many things have changed
but some things remain intact.
I come to a pause, overcome by the passion.Husband, son, father...
Each role that I play
is a milestone of my life,
and every new role that I take
fills me with excitement.
My unique story
will continue to evolve
with every role that I play.Stinger Life

I didn’t set a destination.
I will follow my instincts and venture out.
My daughter gazes at me with curiosity from the back seat.
I dream about the day that we will be sharing
our hobbies together.
I am twice as happy because I have a family
with whom I can enjoy what I like.

with the way that I am today.
Just the way you are,

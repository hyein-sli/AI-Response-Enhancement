THE ULTIMATE PERFORMANCE
The ideal match between a solid, rear-wheel drive platform and a powerful engine.
The engine and steering system were placed in the front and the driving system 
was placed in the back to distribute weight and separate the functions for superior 
maneuverability and driving performance. The enhanced traction of the rear 
wheels provides decisive acceleration, while an optimized weight allocation and 
low-slung seating profile render a highly dynamic drive. An extended wheelbase, 
normally used in mid to full size cars, contributes to a spacious cabin.A new, rear-wheel drive platform

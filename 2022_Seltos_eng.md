cutting-edge features, Seltos embarked on a mission to be a level above in every way, diminishing the significance of the term "small" to a mere size classification. High-class Seltos — Seltos opens a new

that was given for its creation. They will convey lasting impressions that will

Today, SUVs are mostly driven on asphalt, which is why they 
need to evolve and adapt to an urban environment while 
retaining primordial qualities. Seltos captures the bold and 
strong nature of SUVs in an elegant and luxurious way. Its 
10.25" navigation and air conditioning controllers are sleek 
and seamless, while its soft crash pads come with luxurious in-
mold stitching that is normally seen only in vehicles of a higher 
class. Exquisitely made side vents are reminiscent of hand-
crafted goods, speaker and crash pad garnish lighting change 
in brightness to the beat of sounds, seats conform comfortably 
to passengers' body shapes, and a dynamic center console lives up to the toughness of a SUV. All are testaments to 
the utmost care and consideration given to the creation of 
Seltos, which combines multiple elements seamlessly into one, 
resonating the emotional code of millennials who are defining 
the new standards of luxury.

Communication in a car used to be limited to the occupants, but today, we 
live in an era where we can communicate with our cars using large displays. Whether it's your eyes, touch or voice, Seltos engages your 5 senses and 
builds a connection in many ways. It breaks down preconceptions about 
front space and back space and goes beyond the driver's seat. What you do may be different, but in Seltos, front and back spaces offer the same pampering experience that makes a ride equally satisfying no matter where 
you are seated. Being in Seltos in itself promises to be a premium experience.Space, challenging preconceptions
The interior of a car used to be regarded 
simply as a space for transportation.

Gone are the days when the driver had to assess and decide on everything. 
Seltos protects the driver by evaluating every situation and taking decisions 
on its own. Because drivers are usually not the only ones on the road, they 
often need to look after passengers as well as the drivers of other cars and 
pedestrians around them. They not only need to be smart, but they also need 
to be prudent. Drive Wise is the ultimate advanced driver assistance system 
that stops the car automatically, maintains lanes, controls distance and speed, 
and warns the driver about obstacles to prevent accidents. It helps Seltos to 
act really smart.POWERFUL & FUTURISTIC
